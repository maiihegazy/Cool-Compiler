## Assignments

### A1: Lexer Analyser
Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. The lexical analyzer breaks the source code into a series of tokens, and passes the data to the parser when it demands.

### A2: Parser
Parsing (or syntax analysis) is the second phase of a compiler. A parser takes the input from a lexical analyzer in the form of token streams and analyzes the source code (token stream) against the production rules to detect any errors in the code. The output of this phase is an abstract syntax tree (AST).
